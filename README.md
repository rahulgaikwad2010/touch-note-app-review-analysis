An AI solution which cognitively able to detect(classify) reviews in fractions of seconds. hence, fewer human interventions, more precise, uniform results, and most importantly operational efficiency.

## Model Training Part



## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If successfully installed, Change values in config file.
```
[Path]
ModelMappingFilePath = .\models\model_mapping.json
etc..
```

Now, you can run project as follows
```
python run.py
```

You can run a test as follows
```
C:\Users\Alice> python run.py
 * Serving Flask app "run" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

### Usage

##### Docker file
```
FROM python:3.7 
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt 
EXPOSE 5000
RUN python -m nltk.downloader popular
ENTRYPOINT [ "python" ] 
CMD [ "run.py" ] 
```

##### Build the Docker image

Make sure you are in root directory of the project and run the following command.

```
docker build --tag touchnote-review-analysis-app .
```

The above command will create an app with the tag touchnote-review-analysis-app

##### Run the docker image we just created

```
docker run --name touchnote-review-analysis-app -p 5000:5000 touchnote-review-analysis-app
```
 
##### Create a new image from a container’s changes

```
docker commit container-id user-name/touchnote-review-analysis-app:latest
```

##### Before pushing to docker hub repo login into docker hub using docker account

```
docker login
```

##### Push an image to a registry

```
docker push user-name/touchnote-review-analysis-app:latest
```

Progress bars are shown during docker push, which show the uncompressed size. The actual amount of data that’s pushed will be compressed before sending, so the uploaded size will not be reflected by the progress bar.
